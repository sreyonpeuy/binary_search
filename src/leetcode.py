'''
All of the functions in this file are classic leetcode style interview questions.
They all take a container xs as input and run in time O(log n),
where n is the length of xs.

JOKE: There are 2 hard problems in computer science:
1. cache invalidation,
2. naming things, and
3. off-by-1 errors.

It's really easy to have off-by-1 errors in these problems.
Pay very close attention to your list indexes and your < vs <= operators.

def find_smallest_positive(xs):
    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from LOWEST to HIGHEST.
    Find the index of the smallest positive number.
    If no such index exists, return `None`.

    HINT:
    This is essentially the binary search algorithm from class,
    but you're always searching for 0.

    HINT:
    This is the mirror image of find_smallest_positive:
    both functions search for the boundary at 0,
    but they return different sides of that boundary.

    Return the index of that element, or `None` if xs is empty.

    NOTE:
    This is the discrete analogue of argmin in src/argmin.py:
    argmin minimizes a convex function over the reals,
    and find_smallest minimizes a list of numbers.

    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from HIGHEST to LOWEST,

    Calculate the number of times that x occurs in xs.

    HINT:
    Use the following three step procedure:
        1) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value >= x
        2) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value < x
        3) return the difference between step 1 and 2
    I highly recommend creating stand-alone functions for steps 1 and 2,
    and write your own doctests for these functions.
    Then, once you're sure these functions work independently,
    completing step 3 will be easy.
